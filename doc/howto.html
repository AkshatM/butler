    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <i>Quora Butler</i> is a litle Chrome extension that gives you a 1-click way
to send a reply to a comment. You can customize what that reply is, the default is
"Thanks for the input. Did you want this to be an answer, instead of a comment?".</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Installation is clunky right now, sorry about that. Do these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Download the files</b>. Go to <code>https://github.com/kfishkin/butler</code>,
      and click the button that says 'Download ZIP'. Extract that zip file somewhere,
      note that it gave you a directory called <code>butler-master</code>.</li>
      <li><b>Install the extension</b>. In Chrome (this is Chrome only),
      go to <code>chrome://extensions</code>. Make sure you click the box that says 'Developer mode'.
      <br>
      <img src="pix/developer_mode.png"/>
      </li>
      <li>Now click the button that says <code>Load unpacked extension...</code>. Navigate to the
      <code>butler-master</code> directory you just made, and select it.
      You should now see info about the butler appearing on that page:
      <img src="pix/butler_extension_loaded.png"/>
      <br>
      And you should also see the butler icon appear in your chrome toolbar:
      <br>
      <img src="pix/butler_icon_toolbar.png"/>
      </li>
      </ol>
    <h2>Use</h2>
    <p>
    Once the extension has been installed, using it is, well, still kinda clunky,
    but here you go:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Navigate to some Quora page with comments that you might want to reply to</b>.
      This could be some answer of yours with lots of comments, some notification about some comment added to an answer of yours, whatever.
      For example, here's one that <b>Akshat Mahajan</b> did for me to help in testing this plugin,
      you can see it at <a href='https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-funny-and-bizarre-road-signs-worth-slowing-down-for/answer/Ken-Fishkin'>this page</a> -
      I've also added some other bogus comments so you can see how this work when there's
      more than one comment on an answer:
      <br>
      <img src="pix/comments_before.png"/>
      </li>
      <li><b>Click on the butler icon in the toolbar.</b> You will see a little form
      that looks like this:
      <br>
      <img src="pix/popup_dialog.png"/>
      </li>
      <li>Stuff in whatever text you'd like the 1-step reply to have for its reply.
      There is a default, you don't have to do this. In this case, I'll use the default.
      </li>
      <li>Now, hit the 'Click to decorate' button. You will now see that little 'butler'
      icons now appear on your Quora page, one per comment:
      <br>
      <img src="pix/comments_after_decoration.png"/>
      </li>
      <li>If you then click on one of these icons, it will 'reply' to the comment
      that it is next to, with the text you specified in the popup.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, suppose we click on the icon by Akshat's comment. Then you will
    quickly see your page change to look like this:
    <br>
    <img src="pix/after_reply.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>And there you have it! Try it out, let me know what you think, also it's on
    github so I welcome improvements.</p>
