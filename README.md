Quora butler
This is a Chrome extension that attempts to let you
easily put "This is an answer, not a comment" text as a
reply to a comment.
To use:
1) goto chrome://extensions
2) check the 'developer mode' toolbox
3) click 'Load unpacked extension...'
4) Select this directory.

Make sure the extension is enabled.
Now...

1) go to some random quora page
2) have the comments you are interested in available
3) Click the icon for the popup in the chrome toolbar.
4) Set the reply text as you wish.
5) Click the 'Click to decorate' button

You should now see a little 'butler' icon to the right
of each comment. Click it, and it will stuff in the
reply text from step (4), and then hit the 'reply' button.
