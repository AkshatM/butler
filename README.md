Quora butler
This is a Chrome extension that attempts to let you
easily put "This is an answer, not a comment" text as a
reply to a comment.
To use:
1) goto chrome://extensions
2) check the 'developer mode' toolbox
3) click 'Load unpacked extension...'
4) Select this directory.
Make sure the extension is enabled.
Now, whenever you're in Quora, you should see a 'Decorate'
button at the top right of your screen. To use it,
1) go to some random quora page
2) have the comments you are interested in available
3) click the 'Decorate' button
You should now see a little 'butler' icon to the right
of each comment. Click it, and it will stuff in the
"this should be an answer" text, and hit "Reply".

For now, this is buggy - you have to hit the 'Reply' button yourself.

Also, the text to stuff is wired into the JS - you should be able
to set this by clicking on the 'butler' icon in the Chrome toolbar,
and typing what you want into that text box.
